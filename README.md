# Atmel Studio RF24NetworkLib
Ready to go RF24 Network library for Atmel Studio. 

The library is cloned from [TMRh20/RF24Network](https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24Network).

Currently only the XMEGA D3 family is supported and tested!

In order to build this, the library [akatran/Atmel-Studio_RF24Lib](https://github.com/akatran/Atmel-Studio_RF24Lib) needs to be in the same root path.
